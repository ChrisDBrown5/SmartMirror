# PhotonMirror
Aka Magic Mirror

Photon Mirror runs on Python 2.7

This project uses a few modules I found from the internet, including Graphics by Zelle, PYOWM for weather, and Datetime. 
All work other than creating the modules was coded by me (For now, Chris Brown, 10/15/2016).

I started this project 10/15/2016.

Future additions will include facial recognition, calander view, voice recognition, possibly filters, traffic situations (to work or other common places), touchscreen capabilities, and really anything else I can think of creating.
