# Smart Mirror
Aka Magic Mirror

Photon Mirror runs on Python 2.7 AND NOW 3.5!

This project uses a few modules I found from the internet, including tkinter, PYOWM for weather, and Datetime. 
All work other than creating the modules was coded by me (For now, Chris, 10/15/2016).

I started this project 10/15/2016.

Future additions will include calander view, voice recognition, possibly picture filters, traffic situations (to work or other common places), touchscreen capabilities, and really anything else I can think of creating.
